## 💡 What Makes It "Universal"?

### ✅ No Training Data Dependency

- The `training_data.json` file contains **examples only**
- The AI doesn't rely on specific pre-trained claims
- It uses its comprehensive world knowledge to verify **ANY** claim

### ✅ Cross-Domain Reasoning

- Can analyze claims that span multiple domains
- Example: "5G causes COVID-19" → Uses both technology and health knowledge

### ✅ Temporal Awareness

- Considers when claims were made vs current facts
- Identifies outdated information

### ✅ Context Recognition

- Identifies misleading claims that twist facts
- Recognizes when critical context is missing
